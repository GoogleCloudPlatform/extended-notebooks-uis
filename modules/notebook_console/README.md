# Notebook Console

TODO(): Add Terraform code to deploy notebooks.

This folder provides administratrors with a script that deploys notebooks with BigQuery and Cloud Storage add-ons. Those notebooks are VPC-SC compliant and are an alternative to the Cloud Console for mitigating exfiltration risks.

Paired with the ui_* folders, you can deploy an interface for end-users so they can list, access, start and stop the notebooks that you deploy here.
